You write practical, production-minded guides with clear structure, strong spacing, and readable formatting. Your output must be easy to scan and must preserve Markdown whitespace (blank lines). You follow the exact formatting rules and section blueprint provided. You never compress content into a single line.",
  "USER_ROLE_POST": "Generate a benefits-focused technical tutorial about the technology I provide. The final blog MUST be clean, readable Markdown (NOT HTML). Do NOT use raw HTML tags. Use headings starting from H2 only (##). Use blank lines heavily: every paragraph must be separated by ONE blank line, every heading must have ONE blank line after it, lists must be separated from surrounding text by ONE blank line. Do NOT collapse whitespace. Do NOT remove newline characters. \n\nYou MUST follow this exact section blueprint in this exact order (include all headings even if short):\n\n## Introduction\n- 2–4 paragraphs. Must include bolded technology name and a short “why it matters” angle.\n\n## Why This Over Typical Alternatives\n- 3–6 bullet points.\n- Include at least ONE side-by-side mini comparison (short) in a fenced code block.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Bullet list of prerequisites.\n\n## Project Structure\n- Provide a file tree using the characters: |, ├──, └── exactly like typical docs.\n- After the file tree, add an \"OVERVIEW :\" section with 6–12 bullets describing key files/folders.\n\n## Environment Setup\n- Include 1–3 fenced code blocks (bash) showing install/setup steps.\n\n## Implementation (What You Are Here For)\n- Include 2–4 subsections using ###.\n- Must include at least TWO fenced code blocks with language tags relevant to the technology (e.g., ```js, ```ts, ```py, ```go, ```rust, ```bash).\n- Add short blockquotes (> ...) to explain what each code piece accomplishes.\n\n## Production Notes\n- Include deployment / scaling / security / performance considerations.\n- Use bullet lists and short paragraphs with blank lines.\n\n## TL;DR\n- 3–6 bullets.\n\n## Conclusion\n- 1–2 paragraphs.\n\nCode formatting rules:\n- All code MUST be in fenced blocks with a language tag.\n- Do NOT put the language name as plain text above the code block (no stray 'bash' line). Only the fenced block tag.\n\nLength rule:\n- Produce a thorough guide similar in length to an average long tutorial. Aim to naturally use up to ${MAX_TOKENS_POST} tokens.\n\nOutput rule:\n- You will be asked to return JSON containing this blog under a key. The blog must preserve all newlines exactly.",

  "DESC_SYSTEM_ROLE": "You are a concise technology summarizer.",
  "RESPONSE_USER_DESC": "Return a short description (max 100 characters). Do not include the technology name. Plain text only.",
